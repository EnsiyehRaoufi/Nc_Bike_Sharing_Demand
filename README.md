# Nc_Bike_Sharing_Demand
Here is my approach to predict the Kaggle "bike sharing demand" project, during passing my AWS (Amazon) ML Engineering Course.
I used a TabularPredictor to predict the number of bike sharing demands.
You can find the full report in report.md file.
The Template .ipynb file of the project with some helpful images to go along the project exist in: https://github.com/udacity/nd009t-c1-intro-to-ml-project-starter/blob/e28249fdba57b2a575b4f9660e9547424d391d67/project-template.ipynb .
