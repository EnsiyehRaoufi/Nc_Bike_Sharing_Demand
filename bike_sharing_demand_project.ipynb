            "submission_independent_features.csv  2021-12-27 21:53:35  I used a TabularPredictor to predict the 'count' column in the test file. I chose the problem type to be a Regression problem (because that's it!) and I used ‘root_mean_squared_error’ for regression. I ignored the 'casual' and 'registered' columns because they are not existed in the test file.  During reading the csv files, I remembered to parse the datetime, so that I could create two new features 'date' and 'time. I changed the types of features l'season' and 'weather' to the Category format, because AutoGluon originally sees them as ints, but in reality they are int representations of a category. Setting the dtype to category will classify these as categories in AutoGluon. I gave a time limit of 10 minutes to the model fitting and then I predicted the test file's 'count' column using my predictor. At the end I  described the final predictions series to see if there are any negative values, because Kaggle will reject the submission if we don't set everything to be > 0.  complete  0.47959      0.47959       \n",
